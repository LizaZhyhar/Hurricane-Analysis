# Hurricane-Analysis
This project was written to organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. 
\n#1: A function that returns a new list of updated damages where the recorded data is converted to float values and the missing data is retained as "Damages not recorded".
#2: A function that constructs a dictionary made out of the lists, where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data (Name, Month, Year,Max Sustained Wind, Areas Affected, Damage, Death) about the hurricane.
#3: A function that converts the current dictionary of hurricanes to a new dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred in that year.
#4: A function that counts how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane. Store and return the results in a dictionary where the keys are the affected areas and the values are counts of how many times the areas were affected.
#5: A function that finds the area affected by the most hurricanes, and how often it was hit.
#6: A function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest number of deaths, and how many deaths it caused.
#7: A function that rates hurricanes on a mortality scale according to the following ratings, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of deaths for that rating.
#8: A function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest damage, and how costly it was.
#9: A function that rates hurricanes on a damage scale according to the following ratings, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of damage for that rating.
